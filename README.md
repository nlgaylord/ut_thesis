# ut_thesis
LaTeX template for theses and dissertations at the University of Texas at Austin. 
Most current version available anywhere so far as I know.

This repository is designed to be useful to both beginning and experienced 
LaTeX users. 

For those just getting started with LaTeX, 
know youare making a very good decision by writing your thesis in it. The two pdf
documents contained here, sample_masters.pdf and sample_phd.pdf, both
contain enough of a gentle introduction to LaTeX to get you started, and
this project directory helps set you up for some best practices in keeping
all your files organized in the project. The source code itself contains as
many useful tricks as I found reasonable to include in an introduction too.

For experienced LaTeX users,
this repository primarily provides a current version of utthesis2.sty that is compatible with
current Graduate School formatting requirements. I *strongly* recommend also using
at least the preamble contents ut_thesis.tex as well, since my changes have 
introduced numerous new dependencies between it and the version of utthesis2.sty
contained in this repository. In particular the generation of front-matter has been 
completely reworked from previous versions of utthesis2.sty.
